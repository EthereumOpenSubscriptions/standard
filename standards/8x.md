# Specification

## Summary
A standardized interface for interacting with recurring subscriptions.

##  Abstract
This standard defines a contract interface for interacting with subscription data. The 8x suggestions come under the feelings that implementation of how a subscription is created, is left up to the implementor. If we define a standard for implementation, we'll be locking ourselves into one way of doing things.

## Our Thoughts
The idea behind a standard should be an easy way for developers to read/access data regardless of an implementation. A standard shouldn't govern the architecture of a system. It's for this reason that functions such as adding and editing seem application/protocol specific.

Also features such as editing go against the principal of putting users-first. Just because we have the approval to take tokens from a user's wallet, that doesn't mean they should be uninformed of what happens. In the case of a vendor changing prices, they need to create a new plan, revoke the old one and users then need to explicitly upgrade.

For variable subscriptions, that should be a completely new agreement the user enters into. They should be aware they're actually authorizing up to X per every Y. Trying to accommodate it in a standard feels too far fetched as there's multiple ways you might want to implement it.

The code presented is 8x's collectible interface. The bare minimum to have recurring subscription payments for different use-cases. It's what we plan to use when the executor references a subscription contract.

Rather than instantiating that specific contract, it simply instantiates a collectible interface with a particular address. We believe other developers should be able to do this for their applications too.

## Motivation
We want to set a standard for interacting with Layer 2 protocols, not how those protocols operate.

###### getAmountDueFromSubscription
```SOLIDITY
/** @dev Gets the token amount due from the subscription.
  * @param _subscription is the identifier of the customer's subscription with its relevant details.

###### getSubscriptionFee
```SOLIDITY
/** @dev Gets the subscription fee.
  * @param _subscription is the identifier of the customer's subscription with its relevant details.
  * @return fee is the subscription fee.
*/

#### Public Functions

###### cancelSubscription
```SOLIDITY

### Conclusion
This is our suggestions for the beginning of a standardization on interaction with subscription data on the Ethereum blockchain. We are open to suggestions, concerns, or rejections. Let's collaborate and build a better ecosystem.
